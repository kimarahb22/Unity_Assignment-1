# Kids Room Physics Playground

An interactive **Unity application** featuring a cozy kids' bedroom where a **ball interacts with blocks using realistic physics**. This project demonstrates Unity's physics system while also showcasing **Unity Asset Store** integrations, such as 3D models, textures, and props.

---

## 🎮 Features

* **Realistic physics simulation**

  * Ball rolls, bounces, and collides with objects naturally.
  * Blocks react dynamically when hit by the ball.

* **Interactive environment**

  * Explore a fully furnished kids' bedroom.
  * Various interactable objects to test physics behavior.

* **Asset Store showcase**

  * Uses high-quality assets from the Unity Asset Store.
  * Demonstrates how different assets can be combined to build immersive scenes.
